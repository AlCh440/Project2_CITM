# Intro

This is a university project where we had to develope a small platformer game.

In this project we learned how to implement XML, save and load data, understanding XML nodes. 

We also learned how to implment different pathfinidg methods, like BFS, Dijkstra, and A*. We used this systems for enemies IA movement, but knowing that there are many more applications.

We studied how entity systems work and their structure for handeling many obj from a single script, and implement this same method for GUI management.

As we wehere working in 2D we learned how to project in an orthogonal view and isometric view.
